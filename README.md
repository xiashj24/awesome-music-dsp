## C++ and general computer science

For the foreseeable future C++ is still going to be the dominant language of DSP

- A tour of C++, 2nd

- Introduction to Algorithms


## Emerging techonolgies

### Cmajor

I think Cmajor is a super interesting language for audio dsp prototyping.

### Faust

Faust has long history and more maintainers than Cmajor, but I find it difficult to use in production.

### Python

- Introduction to Digital Music with Python Programming; Learning Music with Code
- [signalflow](https://github.com/ideoforms/signalflow)
- Think DSP

### Web Audio API

- Working with the Web Audio API
