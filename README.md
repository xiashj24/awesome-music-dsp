## Signal processing textbooks

DSP theories and basic building blocks.

- [Introduction to Signal Processing, 2nd by Sophocles J. Orfanidis](https://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/intro2sp/2e/)

- Digital Audio Signal Processing, 3rd by Udo Zölzer

- [Julius Orion Smith III](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/)

- Discrete-Time Signal Processing, 3rd by Oppenheimer

- Hack Audio by Eric Tarr

## Sound synthesis

Practical resources for building digital synthesizers.

- Developing Virtual Synthesizers with VCV Rack by Leonardo Gabrielli

- Faust [factory library](https://faustlibraries.grame.fr/) and [quick reference](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/blob/master-dev/documentation/faust-quick-reference.pdf)

- [The Canonical Csound Reference Manual](https://www.csounds.com/manual/html/)

- The Computer Music Tutorial, 2nd by Curtis Roads

- Computer Music Instruments II: Reatime and Object-Oriented Audio by Victor Lazzarini

- [Computational Music Synthesis by Sean Luke](https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/synthesis/)

- [musicdsp.org](https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/index.html)

- [Books by Will Pirkle](https://www.willpirkle.com/)

## Virtual Analog

- [The Art of VA Filter Design by Vadim Zavalishin](https://www.native-instruments.com/fileadmin/ni_media/downloads/pdf/VAFilterDesign_2.1.2.pdf)

- [Point to Point library by Hack Audio](https://github.com/HackAudio/PointToPoint_LT)

- Numerical Recipes 3rd Edition: The Art of Scientific Computing
    - because virtual analog is all about iterative solvers!
    - [Eigen: C++ linear algebra library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)

## Oversampling and DSP filter design

- [hiir by Laurent de Soras](https://ldesoras.fr/prod.html#src_hiir)
    - this is the library to checkout when you want high performance oversampling in C++

- python (numpy, scipy and matplotlib)
    - Think DSP

- [Audio EQ Cookbook](https://webaudio.github.io/Audio-EQ-Cookbook/audio-eq-cookbook.html)

## DSP codebase

- [Mutable Instruments](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack)

- [madronalib](https://github.com/madronalabs/madronalib)

- [Audio Toolkit](https://github.com/AudioTK/AudioTK)

- [Synthesis Toolkit (stk)](https://github.com/thestk/stk)

- [Signalsmith DSP library](https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/code/dsp)

- [Orastron Brickworks](https://git.orastron.com/orastron/brickworks)

- [DaisySP](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP)

- [aulib by Victor Lazzarini](https://github.com/aulib/aulib)

## C++ and general computer science

For the foreseeable future C++ is still going to be the dominant language for DSP

- A tour of C++, 2nd

- Introduction to Algorithms

- A philosophy of software design by John Ousterhout

- CMake
    - I find it very important to not be intimidated by CMake because it helps you develop cross-platform C++ software faster. There is no way getting around it.


## Embedded systems

- Making Embedded Systems, 2nd Edition by Elecia White
    - also highly recommend her podcast [Embedded FM](https://embedded.fm/)

## Emerging techonolgies

### Cmajor

I think Cmajor is a super interesting language for audio dsp prototyping.

### Faust

Faust has a long history and way more maintainers than Cmajor, but I find it difficult to use in production prototyping due to its unique syntax.

### Python for audio

- Introduction to Digital Music with Python Programming; Learning Music with Code
- [signalflow](https://github.com/ideoforms/signalflow)

### Rust for audio

Rust is an interesting language for both embedded systems and DSP.

- [fundsp](https://github.com/SamiPerttu/fundsp)

- [nih-plug](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug)

### Web Audio API

- Working with the Web Audio API
